Pages of project druva

the images are from https://undraw.co/
project is made using bootstrap mainly

problems:-
1. About page in the boxes if I am using an api the images are fitting perfectly but when I am trying to use normal images they are getting out of the box.
2. Navbar is not resposible in the courses page(I can resolve it just need some time)
